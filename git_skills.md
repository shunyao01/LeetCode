## üîç Junior MLE/SWE (Expected Git Skills)

For a junior role (MLE or SWE), the skills you've learned so far are more than enough for basic Git usage. Here's a breakdown:

### Core Git Skills:
- **Initialization & Workflow**: You know how to set up a repo, commit changes, and collaborate using `git pull`, `git push`, and branches.
- **Branching and Merging**: You can handle branching and merging, which is important for collaborating with others on a team.
- **Handling Conflicts**: You know how to resolve merge conflicts ‚Äî an essential skill when working in teams.
- **Commit History**: You understand how to view commit history and work with commits using `git log`.
- **Stashing**: You know how to temporarily save your work without committing it, which is a good practice in the early stages of a project.

### Git Best Practices:
- You are following commit message best practices, which is critical in any team environment.
- You understand basic Git workflows, such as using `git pull` to sync changes and making commits with logical changes.

### What Might Be Missing for Junior Roles:
- **Rebasing**: While you've learned the basics, **rebase** is often used to clean up commit history or update your branch with the latest code before merging. It‚Äôs not strictly required for junior roles but is useful in real-world projects.
- **Forking & Pull Requests**: You might want to get familiar with contributing to **open-source projects** or working on **pull requests** for team collaboration.

### Additional Skills for Junior:
- **Forking a Repo**: Familiarity with forking a repo for open-source contributions and sending pull requests.
- **Tagging**: Some junior roles might involve dealing with tags for releases, so this is worth knowing.
- **Workflows**: Understanding **GitHub flow** or **Git flow** for managing code with teams.
- **Basic CI/CD**: Integration with Git tools like **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, etc., for automated testing or deployment could be helpful, but isn't strictly required for junior roles.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Senior MLE/SWE (Expected Git Skills)

For a senior role, you‚Äôll need advanced Git skills that go beyond basic usage and into more complex Git workflows and project management.

### What You‚Äôd Need for Senior:

### Advanced Git Commands:
- **Rebasing**: You should be very comfortable with **interactive rebasing**, cleaning up commit history (squashing), and fixing mistakes in your commit history.
- **Cherry-picking**: Picking specific commits from other branches.
- **Git Submodules/Subtrees**: Knowing how to handle submodules or integrate third-party repositories into your project.
- **Bisecting**: Using `git bisect` to find the exact commit that introduced a bug.
- **Squash and Merge**: Comfort with squashing multiple commits into one before merging to keep the history clean.

### Branching Strategies:
- Experience with different **branching strategies** such as **Git Flow**, **GitHub Flow**, and **Feature Branching.
- Managing long-lived branches like `develop` and `feature` branches, along with handling release and hotfix branches.

### Handling Merge Conflicts in Complex Scenarios:
- Resolving conflicts not just between files but also across multiple feature branches.
- Managing **conflict-free merges** using rebase strategies.

### CI/CD Integration:
- You should be familiar with setting up or managing **Git integration with CI/CD pipelines** (using tools like **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, **Travis CI**).

### Advanced Git Collaboration:
- **Forking, Pull Requests, and Code Reviews**: Understanding of the code review process using pull requests, making code review comments, and how to handle **contributor workflows**.
- You should be experienced with the **codebase review** process (rebasing feature branches, ensuring no conflicts before merge, and reviewing code).

### Other Advanced Concepts:
- **Git Hooks**: Automating tasks such as pre-commit checks or pre-push actions using Git hooks.
- **Git Large File Storage (LFS)**: For handling large files in your repository, commonly needed for games, ML models, or large datasets.
- **Git Internals**: Understanding how Git works under the hood, like how Git objects, commits, and blobs are stored.
