## Repository Structure

### Topics:

- **arrays**: Array problems using hashmaps or hashsets for quick lookups, counting, or tracking elements.
- **backtracking**: Algorithms that explore all possible configurations using recursion and decision trees (e.g., permutations, N-Queens).
- **binary_search**: Problems that apply binary search on arrays or search space (e.g., rotated arrays, min/max value search).
- **dynamic_programming**: Problems requiring overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, often solved using memoization or tabulation.
- **graphs**: Graph representations and traversal techniques such as DFS, BFS, topological sort, and connected components.
- **linked_lists**: Linked list construction, reversal, cycle detection, and pointer manipulation problems.
- **patterns**: Documentation and breakdown of recurring techniques like two pointers, sliding window, fast & slow pointer, etc.
- **recursion**: Problems where the solution involves calling the function on smaller inputs (includes some tree and backtracking problems).
- **sliding_window**: Problems that maintain a window over a subset of data (e.g., max/min in subarrays, longest substring).
- **stack**: Use of stacks for expression evaluation, monotonic stacks, and simulation of other structures.
- **strings**: String manipulation, pattern matching, parsing, and frequency-based logic.
- **system_design**: High-level design notes for large-scale systems and interview preparation (non-coding).
- **trees**: Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder), construction, depth calculations, and binary search trees.
- **two_pointers**: Problems solved using two indices moving toward or away from each other, useful in sorted arrays or strings.
- **arrays & hash**: Problems combining array traversal with hashmap-based lookups or frequency tracking.
